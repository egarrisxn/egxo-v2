When I picked up _Clean Code_ by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob), I was almost three years into my coding journey. I had built projects, pushed production code, and debugged more than a few tangled messes. But something was missing, a sense of craftsmanship, of thinking long-term about code quality. That’s where this book came in, and honestly, it reshaped how I think about programming.

## Why I Reached for _Clean Code_

After a few years of writing code, you start realizing that writing _working_ code isn’t enough. You need it to be _readable_, _maintainable_, and _understandable_, especially by the future version of yourself or by someone else on your team. I’d heard people reference _Clean Code_ like a rite of passage. It’s assigned at bootcamps, recommended in interviews, and quoted in blog posts. So I gave it a shot.

## What Stood Out to Me

Uncle Bob doesn’t just give rules, he gives _reasons_. He breaks down what makes code good, bad, or unmanageable in a way that’s honest and often blunt, but effective. Here’s what hit hardest:

### 1. **Naming is a Discipline**

I used to think good variable or function names just came with experience. This book helped me realize naming is something to actively work on. A good name saves a reader from having to read comments or dig into logic.

### 2. **Functions Should Do One Thing**

This might sound obvious, but when I looked back at my code, I saw how many functions were trying to do three or four things. After reading this, I went back and refactored. The results felt cleaner and easier to follow, instantly.

### 3. **Readability Over Cleverness**

In my early days, I loved finding clever ways to do something in one line. Now I care about whether someone can understand it in five seconds. _Clean Code_ reinforced that simple code is powerful code.

### 4. **Comments Aren’t a Crutch**

The book helped me see that if I’m explaining what a block of code is doing with a comment, I probably need to rethink the code itself. Good code should be self-explanatory.

## How It Changed My Workflow

After finishing the book, I started applying its principles almost immediately. I slowed down and thought more carefully about the structure of each file and function. I did more refactoring. I deleted more code than I wrote, and that’s not a bad thing.

It also changed the way I review others’ code, and my own. I started asking better questions:

- Is this name meaningful?
- Can this be broken down further?
- Will this make sense six months from now?

## It’s Not About Java, It’s About Mindset

While the examples are in Java, I code primarily in TypeScript and JavaScript, and everything still applied. The language isn’t the point, the way you _think_ about code is.

## Would I Recommend It?

Without hesitation. Especially if you’re past the beginner stage and looking to elevate how you _think_ about software, not just how to get it working. _Clean Code_ is more than a checklist, it’s a philosophy of respect toward your future self and your collaborators.

## Final Thoughts

Three years in, this book didn’t teach me how to code, but it taught me how to code _well_. And that made all the difference. It's not about being perfect, it's about continuously improving the way you write, read, and share code. If you haven’t read _Clean Code_ yet, you’re overdue.

```jsx
import React, {useEffect, useState} from 'react'

function UserCard() {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null)

  useEffect(() => {
    async function fetchUser() {
      try {
        const res = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1')
        const data = await res.json()
        setUser(data)
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Failed to fetch user:', error)
      }
    }

    fetchUser()
  }, [])

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{user?.name ?? 'Loading...'}</h1>
      <p>{user?.email ?? 'Fetching email...'}</p>
    </div>
  )
}

export default UserCard
```

## Fetching Data with Modern JavaScript

Working with APIs is a key part of building dynamic web apps, and modern JavaScript makes it easier than ever. In this example, we’re using `async/await` to simplify asynchronous code, `try/catch` for error handling, and optional chaining to safely access object properties.

## Why This Matters

Using `async/await` instead of traditional promises leads to more readable, cleaner code. Combined with `useEffect` and `useState` from React, it becomes straightforward to fetch and display data in a component.

## The Optional Chaining Advantage

Notice the use of `user?.name` and `user?.email`. This is called optional chaining. It helps prevent runtime errors if the `user` object is still null when rendering begins. It’s one of the most useful additions to modern JavaScript.

## Try It Yourself

Replace the API URL with your own endpoint, and experiment with displaying different user data or loading states. This pattern is common in real-world apps, from dashboards to social feeds.
